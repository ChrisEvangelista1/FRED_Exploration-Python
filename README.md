# FRED_Exploration-Python
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is a database maintained by the Research division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that has economic time series data for various topics such as unemployment, housing, and salary.  The objective of this project is to use pandas to explore data sets that look interesting and extract any insights!

The dataset is pulled directly from FRED's API using Python.  The data is wrangled, cleaned, and analyzed using Python pandas; visualization is done using pandas, matplotlib, or seaborn all within a Jupyter notebook

Below are the some of the main analysis and visualization pursued in this project!
